Hello, I hope you have fun playing around with this project.

- The debugable executables files are already generated so there's no need to regenerate them. 

- You can find "args.txt" file to change any needed arguments as a user.

- To run the program you can just type "make" in your terminal and it should run the program (also regenerate the executables).

- You can also run it by running both (./main and ./graphics executables).

- If you type "make clean" in your terminal all executables will be deleted and all processes related to the program should be immediately terminated.

Thank you so much!
